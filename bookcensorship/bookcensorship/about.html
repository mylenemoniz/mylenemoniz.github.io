            <p>I am an incoming senior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst pursuing an English degree and IT minor. I have certificates in Professional Writing and Technical Communications (PWTC) , Computer Competency, and a specialization in Writing, Rhetoric, and Literacy Studies (WRLS). I hope to continue to hone and perfect my professional and technical writing skills, and aspire to start a career in technical writing post grad. This summer I will be interning at Board as a Technical Writing Intern.</p>

            <p>When it comes to writing, I tend to gravitate to a more critical and analytical approach, and enjoy projects where I can demonstrate my research capabilities. They were always my cup of tea when writing, but it wasn’t until I began taking PWTC classes that I began to expand the avenues in which I wrote and produced content. In these courses I’ve produced a grant proposal, instructional manual, a MadCap Flare website, a portfolio website, and a how-to video tutorial. For my capstone project, I taught myself JavaScript and refreshed my HTML/CSS knowledge to create an interactive website to inform my audience about book bans with an audience of junior high school teachers.</p>
            
            <p>Of course, I cannot neglect to mention my WRLS specialization, where I finally grew to write more creatively. As stated before, I have always preferred to keep my writing research and analytic based, and rarely ever broke out of this habit. It wasn’t until junior year that I began to write using the voice I had suppressed for years. With the progymnasmata as a foundation, I began to finally diversify my writing portfolio. Not only has it strengthened my relationship with writing, but it has also inspired me to write creatively as a hobby and not a grade.</p>
