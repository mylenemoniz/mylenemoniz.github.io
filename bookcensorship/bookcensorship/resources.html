    <h1>Free Book Resources</h1>
    <p>As technology has become fully integrated in our everyday lives, it’s gotten more and more commonplace to 
        find an activity that has a technological alternative. One prominent example is reading. According to a survey conducted 
        by the Pew Research Center, “One-fifth of American adults (21%) report that they have read an e-book in the past year.” An 
        e-book is a book provided in a digital format. E-books can be accessed via the internet, applications, or on a plethora of devices with the option to read electronically, or 
        e-read. E-reading refers to reading on portable devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and devices geared around reading 
        electronically, or e-readers, such as Kindles and Nooks. With the emergence of e-reading, reading has become more accessible as with e-reading technology you can adjust the settings your book 
        will display in, share books with more ease, use interactive elements, and not worry about the general upkeep of your book(s).
      
    <p>As book bans surge, it is important to have access to free e-reading resources. Below are some of my favorite sites and/or applications for reading for free.</p>
