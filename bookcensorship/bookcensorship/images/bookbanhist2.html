<h1>Brief History of Book Bans in the United States</h1>

<p>The United States is no stranger to book bans. In fact, book bans have been a part of U.S. history since the beginning. 
    From the first banning in the then United Colonies, to the media panic concerning comic books, to legislature protecting 
    books and free speech, the history of book bans in the U.S. is vast. Below is a brief timeline of the history of book bans 
    and censorship in the United States sourced from <a href="https://pen.org/censorship-history-book-bans/" target="_blank">PEN America</a>.</p>

        <div class="grid-text">
          <h2>Thomas Morton's <i>New English Canaan</i></h2>
          <p>Thomas Morton’s <i>New English Canaan</i> ridiculed and critiqued the customs of Puritan settlers, who left England for the New World in search of freedom of religion
            Having arrived in Massachusetts in 1924, the businessman was not a fan of the way the Puritans operated. Morton was critical of the way the Puritans treated the Native Americans, and he was equally subject to scorn for his dealings with the Natives. However, this does not mean he didn’t mistreat Native Americans, as he participated in colonizing their land and perpetuating negative stereotypes.

            Morton first attempted to publish <i>New English Canaan</i> in England in 1933, but the printing process was put to a stop.</p>
            <p>It wasn’t until 1637 that he was able to publish his book in Amsterdam, where officials tried to forbid the book from entering the colonies. This did not help the already rising tensions between Morton and the Puritans, and it resulted in the banning of his book. 
            
            After the publishing of <i>New English Canaan</i>, Morton attempted to return to Massachusetts only to be swiftly turned away. It wasn’t until he braved the journey once again in 1643 that he found himself back in the English colonies and jailed in Boston. On account of his failing health, he was released from prison in 1645 and was exiled to Maine where he spent the remainder of his days, until he died in 1647
            
            Today, <i>New English Canaan</i> is regarded as one of the most important books of Colonial America and Thomas Morton is remembered as the author of the first book ban in the New World.</p>

          <h2>1852: Harriet Beecher Stowe’s <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i></h2>
          <p>Published in 1852, <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> by Harriet Beecher Stowe is known as the first book in the U.S. to be published on a national scale. Stowe, an abolitionist, wrote the book to showcase the reality of slavery and challenged the beliefs that black people did not have the same mental and emotional capacities as white people.</p> 

          <p>Worried about the effects that <i>Uncle Tom’s Cabin</i> would have on slavery, a point of contention between the northern and southern states, enslavers sought to have the book removed from circulation in the South.</p>

          <h2>1925: Scopes ‘Monkey’ Trial in Tennessee</h2>
          <p>John T. Scopes, a Tennessee’s Butler Act, legislation that stated teaching any belief that went against the creation of man as portrayed in the Bible was unlawful. Scopes used A Civil Biology by George W. Hunter prior to the trial. This trial erupted during a time of socio-political disarray in the United States, as Prohibition, strict immigration policies, and a shift in gender roles and behavior were at an all time high.</p>

<p>Scopes was convicted and fined $100, however his conviction was overturned. Despite this, other states soon followed suit and implemented similar laws. Due to this, the theory of human evolution virtually disappeared from high school biology books in the U.S. until the 1960s.</p>

    <div class="grid-text">
      <h2>1954: Comics Code</h2>
      <p>One of the most severe examples of censorship in U.S. history, the 1954 Comics Code was written to answer the nationwide anti-comics movement. Carol Tilley, a comic historian, claims 80 to 90 percent of children were reading comic books at the time. Parents were concerned at the perceived graphic content of comic books due to an immense surge in horror graphic novels. Due to the ban, 75% of comics published went out of business.</p>

      <p>It is important to note that this is another example of a media panic. Coined by Kirsten Drotner, a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0030923990350303" target="_blank">media panic</a> refers to the “emotionally charged reactions on the appearance of new media.” This has been a common theme in U.S. history and can be used to describe public outcries in response to the creation and growing popularity of television, rock n’ roll, video games, etc. Media panics are fueled by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/moral-panic#:~:text=In%20his%20book%20titled%20Folk,values%20(Cohen%2C%202014)" target="_blank">moral panics</a>, coined by Stanley Cohen, in which “inappropriate public hysteria generated by media focus on a specific fear.”</p>

      <h2>1968: <i>Epperson v. Arkansas</i></h2>
      <p>Susan Epperson, a biology teacher in Little Rock, Arkansas, claimed that the Arkansas legislature that prohibited teachers in public schools violated her First Amendment right to free speech and the <a href="https://www.uscourts.gov/about-federal-courts/educational-resources/about-educational-outreach/activity-resources/first-amendment-and-religion#:~:text=The%20Establishment%20clause%20prohibits%20the,as%20the%20Church%20of%20England" target="_blank">Establishment Clause</a>, a clause that restricts the government from establishing a religion. When brought to the Supreme Court, the justices had to answer whether the teaching of evolution violated either the free speech rights of teachers or the Establishment clause of the First Amendment.</p>

      <p>In an unanimous decision, The Court found that the law violated the First Amendment rights of teachers.</p>

      <h2>1973: <i>Miller v. California</i></h2>
      <p>Marvin Miller, an owner of a business that sold pornographic content, mailed advertising material that depicted explicit sexual imagery. Miller was soon convicted of violating a California statute which prohibited the distribution of obscene material. This was soon brought to the Supreme Court to answer if the sale and distribution of obscene content by mail was protected under the First Amendment. Needing a definition on for what constitutes obscenity in order to crack down on inappropriate media content, Supreme Court outlined a standard for what is considered obscene:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>appeals to prurient interest</li>
      <li>depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and</li>
      <li>lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p> In a 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that obscene materials did not have First Amendment protection. This then led to the creation of the <a href="https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/miller-test/" target="_blank">Miller test</a>, “the primary legal test for determining whether expression constitutes obscenity.” The Miller test outlines the following criteria:</p>
      
      <ol>
      <li>Whether the average person sees the material as having/encouraging excessive sexual interest based on community standards.</li>
      <li>Whether the material depicts or describes sexual conduct in a clearly offensive way as defined by the applicable state law, and</li>
      <li>Whether the work, when considered in its entirety, “lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.”</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>The Miller test was and is still used today to justify the banning of books or any content deemed obscene.</p>

      <h2>1982: <i>Island Trees School District v. Pico</i></h2>
      <p>In 1982, the Island Trees Board of Education was sent a list of books labeled inappropriate by Parents of New York United. In response to the concerned parents, the school board removed the following books from school libraries:</p>

        <ul>
        <li><i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.</li>
        <li><i>The Naked Ape</i>, by Desmond Morris</li>
        <li><i>Down These Mean Streets</i>, by Piri Thomas</li>
        <li><i>Best Short Stories of Negro Writers</i>, edited by Langston Hughes</li>
        <li><i>Go Ask Alice</i>, of anonymous authorship</li>
        <li><i>Laughing Boy</i>, by Oliver LaFarge</li>
        <li><i>Black Boy</i>, by Richard Wright</li>
        <li><i>A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich</i>, by Alice Childress</li>
        <li><i>Soul on Ice</i>, by Eldridge Cleaver</li>
        <li><i>A Reader for Writers</i>, edited by Jerome Archer</li>
        <li><i>The Fixer</i>, by Bernard Malamud</li>
        </ul>
        
    <p>The school board labeled the books as: <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1981/80-2043">"anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-Semitic, and just plain filthy."</a> Steven Pico, a student, brought this case to the federal district court to challenge the removal of said books. The Board won and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  reversed the ruling.</p>
        
    <p>The Island Trees Board of Education petitioned the Supreme Court and The court decided on whether the board’s decision to ban books from its school libraries based on their content violated the First Amendment. In a 5-to-4 decision, The Court concluded that this was a violation of the First Amendment and the Board couldn’t restrict access to books in its libraries because its members disagreed with the content.</p>
