                    <p>In the United States, books from a wide range of authors and genres are being suppressed and silenced. 
                        Public institutions such as libraries and schools are also being threatened by those who want to control what 
                        books we have ready access to. To combat this, I decided to create a website to provide access to the books being 
                        banned through free e-reading applications such as <a href=”http://libbyapp.com/” target="_blank">Libby</a> and 
                        <a href=”https://www.hoopladigital.com/” target=”_blank”>Hoopla</a>, educate the public on the history of book 
                        censorship in the U.S., and interactive charts to represent book ban statistics. The main objective of this website 
                        is to keep the public, especially teachers, informed about the ongoing bans and to encourage users to support their 
                        public libraries and institutions.</p> 
                
        
                    <p>This website spans across five pages, all with the intention of informing the public about book bans as well as the 
                    ins and outs of the creation process. The five pages include a home/landing page, a historical perspective on book bans 
                    in the U.S., statistics representing the frequency of certain banned categories, free book resources, and an about the author 
                    page. Using <a href="https://pen.org/">PEN America</a> as a major source, with this website I hope to address the ongoing problem of the surge book censorship in the U.S., keep the public informed, 
                    and provide free e-reading resources if they are not able to have physical access to banned book titles. My target audience is 
                    middle school teachers who wish to know more about book censorship, their rights regarding teaching banned book titles, and where 
                    they can access said titles at no cost to them.</p>
        
                    <p>This website was one and a half months in the making, and was created using HTML/CSS and Javascript. To ensure this website is 
                    accessible, I made sure my website followed the <a href=”https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/” target=”_blank”>Web Content Accessibility 
                    Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a> and input my website into the <a href=”https://wave.webaim.org/”>WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation 
                    Tool</a>.
