    <h1>I Hate Writing Poems</h1>
 

<div class="poem">
<p>i'm sitting here trying to write down how i feel</p>
<p>i've never tried to before, this doesn't feel real</p>
<p>i'm trying to write this poem and rhyme</p>
<p>how to people do this, how do they have the time</p>
<br>
<p>three semesters of teaching and work</p>
<p>you accepted us and all of our quirks</p>
<p>one of the first teachers to really see what i could do and who i could be</p>
<p>i'm constantly left wondering, does she really mean me?</p>
<p>clearly i'm no dr seuss</p>
<p>writing poetry is irritating, i feel so obtuse</p>
<br>
<p>we exist in a structure where we must play out our roles</p>
<p>and because of you i've reached one of my goals</p>
<p>that was a really cheap rhyme, sorry i'm trying to finish my finals and i'm in the middle of my grind</p>
<p>but i hope you don't mind</p>
<br>
<p>maybe i could have done this a different way</p> 
<p>but hopefully you get what i'm trying to say</p>
</div>

<br>
<br>
<p>I'm the worst at writing poems, but I wanted to somehow show my appreciation in a way that meant something. Hope you enjoyed the worst poem ever written by yours truly.</p>
